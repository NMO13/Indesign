# Indesign

Code for product catalog

## Installation

Open the scripts panel in InDesign (Window > Automation > Scripts in CS3 and CS4; or Window > Utilities > Scripts in CS5 or later), then right-click on either Application or User. Hold the cmd-Key and double click on User. Finder should open. Inside the folder that opens there is a folder called Scripts panel. Put your scripts inside that.
Any script inside the Scripts Panel folder will show up immediately in InDesign. No need to restart the program.

Open the "CallMain.jsx" file. The main function has two parameters which need to be adjusted:
- the folder which contains the json files
- a directory where the downloaded images will be stored temporarily

To run the script, click on "CallMain.jsx" in the scripts panel. Indesign should immediately start to create a new document and execute the script.
